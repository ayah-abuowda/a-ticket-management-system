## Getting started

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone git@git.ita.chalmers.se:courses/dit341/group-00-web.git

# Change into the directory
cd group-00-web

# Setup backend
cd server && npm install
npm run dev

# Setup frontend
cd client && npm install
npm run serve
```

> Check out the detailed instructions for [backend](./server/README.md) and [frontend](./client/README.md).

## Visual Studio Code (VSCode)

Open the `server` and `client` in separate VSCode workspaces or open the combined [backend-frontend.code-workspace](./backend-frontend.code-workspace). Otherwise, workspace-specific settings don't work properly.

## System Definition (MS0)

### Purpose

The project is a ticket management system where a user can buy and reserve tickets for their bus journeys. The user logs in or registers to the system, then sees scheduled buses, travel dates and the vacant seats. The user can proceed with the reservation if they want. The reservation is made by adding personal information and a convenient payment method for the user. After the payment process is successful, the user gets an activation code for their ticket that can be used while travelling.

### Pages

* Login screen: The user can login or sign-up to the system. To login, they will be required to give their login credentials.
* History: The user can see their scheduled tickets, past tickets and other information regarding their travels.
* User profile: The user can see and edit the personal information that they have provided to the system.
* Home screen: The user can search, save and buy tickets from this page.
